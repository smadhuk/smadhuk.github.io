<h1>The art of profiling</h1>
My co-worker recently posed me a fairly simple problem. He had some
fairly simple C++ code.
<pre> 
    void replace_conditionally(const std::bitset& bitset, std::vector&lt;int&gt; candidates, int replacement_value) {
      if (bitset[i]) {
        candidate[i] = replacement_value;
      }
    }
  </pre>
<p>He wanted to optimize this code as much as he could. Since this
code was so simple, I though it would be a fun exercist to see how
far we could take optimizing this code.</p>
<p>I'm a SWE on a high performance computing team. I have to admit
that most of the optimization work that I have done has been inside
of Google. I'm unfamilar with how to use open source stuff.</p>
<p> Let's see what we can do here! </p>

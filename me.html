  I was born on September 29, 1995 in Lucknow, India. Nobody asked me whether I was OK with it, which I think was quite rude, but I made my peace with Arti and Sushil Madhuk. <br>
  We spent a few months in Lucknow, where my grandparents were marshalled into the act of baby raising, but packed up our bags and moved to Ahmedabad soon thereafter. <br>
  Parochial peacefulness would best describe Ahmedabad, but in spite of that, my parents found a group of hell-raisers to eat mutton and drink whiskey with. They were to become the lifelong buddies of my parents, essentially second sets of parents to me.
